ABSTRACT = {In recent years, deep learning has dominated medical image segmentation. Encoder-decoder architectures, such as U-Net, can be used in state-of-the-art models with powerful designs that are achieved by implementing skip connections that propagate local information from an encoder path to a decoder path to retrieve detailed spatial information lost by pooling operations. Despite their effectiveness for segmentation, these na&iuml;ve skip connections still have some disadvantages. First, multi-scale skip connections tend to use unnecessary information and computational sources, where likable low-level encoder features are repeatedly used at multiple scales. Second, the contextual information of the low-level encoder feature is insufficient, leading to poor performance for pixel-wise recognition when concatenating with the corresponding high-level decoder feature. In this study, we propose a novel spatial-channel attention gate that addresses the limitations of plain skip connections. This can be easily integrated into an encoder-decoder network to effectively improve the performance of the image segmentation task. Comprehensive results reveal that our spatial-channel attention gate remarkably enhances the segmentation capability of the U-Net architecture with a minimal computational overhead added. The experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the conventional deep networks in term of Dice score, which achieves 71.72%.},
